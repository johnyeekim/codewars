### Codewars-Python

**Decription**
<br>
In the spirit of Kata as "structured practice for consistent improvement", this repo contains my Python Kata from Codewars. I have included comments as a personal reference and as a method for learning the language.

**File Naming Convention**
<br>
'[####]a \<kataname\>.py' represents my Kata solutions
<br>
'[####]b \<kataname\>.py' represents best practice Kata solutions from the community.'
