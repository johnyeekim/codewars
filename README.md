**Decription**
In the spirit of Kata as "structured practice for consistent improvement", this repo contains my Python Kata from Codewars. I have included comments that are helpful as a personal reference and a method for learning the language.

**File Naming Convention**
'####a represents my Kata solutions'
'####b represents Kata solutions from the community that are considered best practice.'
